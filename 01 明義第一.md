# Chapter 1: Introduction

Programming is a way to harness a machine, and a machine is used to replace human labor. Machines have a range of capabilities and can compute fast, but they are not clever, thus it takes a man to write down instructions, like commands to an army. These instructions make a program. The machine can then understand said program, and can be made use of by people to perform various tasks.

Question: Machines are just a lump of metal, how can it understand human words and be of use for people?
Answer: This is why we have programming languages.
When people talk, we sometimes use fancy words or reference other things, which of course the machines cannot understand. On the other hand, machines can only understand a handful of things, namely AND, OR and NOT (i.e. the logic gates), which is too close to the metal and is hard to use for people. Thus, we take an in-between approach: take human language, extract the most fundamental elements, select some particular words and strictly define their meaning. This would be understandable by people, and also able to be "translated" for machines to execute. This is what we call a programming language. Our rules of mathematics is fundamentally the same, despite used for a different purpose.

Question: What makes a program good?
Answer: Two things, how clever it is and how neat it is.
When we perform a job, there are often more than one approaches. Among these approaches, we would naturally avoid using those that are less efficient. Programmers study and develop algorithms, and better algorithms can calculate more accurately or faster. This is what we mean by "clever".
Code is like an essay; if you mindlessly put words together, it would be difficult to understand, and more likely to have mistakes. Code that are written neatly can make people understand its logic better, and can have less errors when executed by a machine. This is what we mean by "neat".

Question: You say programming is good, but I don't program for a living, and I'm not into that anyways. Why should I bother learning it?
Answer: Even if you don't use it, learning to program is also a good exercise for your mind, in particular, careful, clear logical thinking. Also it's fun.
Question: How comes it's fun? I thought programming is like sitting in front of a full screen of letters all day and all the frustration from errors in the code.
Answer: The fun in programming is in creating, just like how painting and crafting is fun.
Question: Yeah, I can see how programming is good, but where do I start?
Answer: Right here, with this book!

Before we begin to learn more about programming, we first need to understand some terminologies:

- **Code** or **source code** is the text of the program. Depending on what it does, it can be as short as a few lines or as long as hundreds of pages.
- **Compilers** and **interpreters** are special programs that "translate" programming language into what a machine can understand.
- **Running** or **executing** a program is to make the machine execute the instructions. It might, for example, compute some numbers or perform some other tasks.
- **Errors** or **Exceptions** are what machines tell us when there is a mistake in the program, or when the machine runs into a problem when running the program.

There are hundreds of programming languages out there, each with their own advantages. However most of them are made by westerners, and are based on the English language. Thus we have decided to make Wenyan, a Chinese programming language that takes inspiration from Classical Chinese texts.

When we learn to spell, we start with ABCs, and when we learn to program, we start with "Hello, World." A "Hello, World" program in Wenyan looks like this:

```
吾有一數。曰三。名之曰「甲」。
為是「甲」遍。
	吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。
云云。
```

The output of this program is as follows:

```
問天地好在。
問天地好在。
問天地好在。
```

Question: What is "Hello, World?"
Answer: Before we program our machines, it is dumb and do not know a thing about our world. We enlighten them by programming, bringing them knowledge about the outside world, and we would like them to greet this new horizon with "Hello, World."

Question: Why say that three times? It's not like the the world can hear it better or something.
Answer: Well, this is a demonstration of a **loop**. Loops allows us to repeat some instructions.
Question: Can I loop that 5 times instead? Can I loop that 1000 times?
Answer: Sure!

```
為是五遍。
	吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。
云云。

為是千遍。
	吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。
云云。
```

Question: What about that 甲? Why don't we call that 乙?
Answer: Both would work. This 甲 is merely a name for a value, and a value is, well, whatever you set it to be. If you set it to be 3, it's 3; you set it to be 5, it's 5. That is a **variable**. Observe the following lines:

```
吾有一數。曰三。名之曰「甲」。
吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在。」」。書之。
```

`吾有一數` ("I have a number") and `吾有一言` ("I have a string") indicate the type of the variable. Numbers are for calculations, and strings are text to show to people. Different types of variables should not be confused, and thus we declare them first so that it is clear. 

`曰三` ("It is 3") and `曰「「問天地好在。」」` ("It is 'Hello, World'") are the values of the variables. If we ask for the value of that number, we know it is 3. Same for the string.

`名之曰「甲」` ("Name it '甲'") is the name of the variable. Variables can change under the same name, for example, the line of code below changes the value of 甲 to 4:

```
昔之「甲」者。今四是矣。
```

`書之` ("Write it down", or in common programming terms, "print") is to make the computer show the result to us. Otherwise we would not have known the results.

Question: That 甲 is surrounded by that edgy thing. What's that? Can I leave it out?
Answer: No, that's a quotation mark. A 「single quotation mark」 indicates the name of variables, and a 「「double quotation mark」」 indicate a string. These are used to separate these from the rest of the code, and despite minor, they cannot be omitted.
Question: What about the full stops (little circles) and indentation?
Answer: These are only for readability, and you can leave them out. Thus the example from above can also be written as:

```
吾有一數曰三名之曰「甲」為是「甲」遍吾有一言曰「「問天地好在」」書之云云
```

This should be enough explanation for the "Hello, World" example.
