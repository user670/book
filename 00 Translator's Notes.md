# Translator's Notes

This English translation of *An Introduction to Programming in Wenyan Language* is translated by me, User670.

First, I must admit that I'm **not fluent in either Classical Chinese nor English**. My first language is (contemporary) Mandarin Chinese, and despite having to learn Classical Chinese in school, I never got good at reading them. I learn English as a second/foreign language. There **will** be parts that I cannot fully understand the original text and/or cannot find the best way to express the idea in English.

There are also some liberties that I often take in order to make it easier for me or to make the translation easier to understand (such as leaving out unnecessary metaphors or Chinese cultural references). The translation will cover all programming-related ideas in the original text, but will not be a word-for-word translation.

## Chapter-specific notes

### Chapter 1: Introduction
- The paragraph leading into the terminologies. In the original text, it says that programming started in the west with terms never heard of in ancient China, and thus need explanation so that everyone can understand. That would not make that much sense for an English context, thus I stripped it down to that.
- ¼× and ÒÒ are Chinese "Heavenly Stems". ¼× and ÒÒ are the first and second of the Heavenly Stems respectively, and thus are often used to mean "first" and "second" (as in grades, or as in order). The English equivalent would be `a` and `b`, as in `var a=3;`.
