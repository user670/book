# Chapter 2: Variables
In [*I Ching*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) ("Book of Changes"), it says, "changes are the ups and downs of Yin and Yang". As for programming, the foundations are built on changing values, i.e. **variables**.
What are variables? They are names that name things. You might have a thing that changes but keeps a single name; or you might have multiple names referring to the same thing. We also categorize the variables into **types**. In the end, a variable has a name to call, a value it holds, and a type to indicate its use.

What are types? It can be a **number, string, boolean, array/list, object/dictionary, or function.** Numbers are for calculations and strings are texts to show, as explained in the previous chapter. The rest are explained below:

- **Booleans** are yes/no or true/false values. Whenever something has two possibilities, you can express it as a boolean.
- **Arrays** or **lists** list many things of the same type.
- **Objects** or **dictionaries** describe the properties of a thing. For example, a person may have a "name" attribute (which is a string), an "age" attribute (which is a number), and a "sex" attribute (forgive the lack of consideration of non-binary genders, but for most people, it's a boolean). This whole collection is this person object.
- **Functions** are instructions to perform a task.

Should you know a name, value and type of a variable, you can declare it as following:

```
吾有一數。曰三。名之曰「甲」。
吾有一爻。曰陰。名之曰「乙」。
吾有一言。曰「「噫吁戲」」。名之曰「丙」。
```

If you don't know its name but you know its value and type, declare it like this:

```
吾有一數。曰三。
```

Unnamed variables will be tracked by the machine and waits for it to be used. The word `其` ("it") is used to refer to the last unnamed variable, like this:

```
吾有一數。曰三。加其以五。減其以二。書之。
```

When you say `加其以五` ("Add 5 to it"), the "it" is 3. When it reaches `減其以二` ("Subtract 2 from it"), the "it" is 8. After taking the 2 away, you get 6.

You can also descrive a variable when you know its name but *not* its type. However it is more complex and we will discuss it in a later chapter.

**Question:** I have more than one number. I want 3, or 5, or a million numbers, can I express that?
**Answer:** That's easy:

```
吾有三數。曰三。曰九。曰二十七。名之曰「甲」。曰「乙」。曰「丙」。
```

Also, `吾有一數曰` ("I have a number, it is") can also be written as `有數` ("Have number"). So the following two lines are the same:

```
有數三。名之曰「甲」。
吾有一數。曰三。名之曰「甲」。
```

Also, if you do not specify a value, numbers default to 0, booleans default to false, and strings default to an empty string (i.e. `""`). So the following three lines are the same:

```
吾有一數。曰零。名之曰「甲」。
吾有一數。名之曰「甲」。
有數零。名之曰「甲」。
```

After creating a variable, you can change it later like this:

```
昔之「甲」者。今四是矣。
昔之「乙」者。今「甲」是矣。
```

The first line changes 甲 to 4, the next line changes 乙 to 甲 (or rather, to be the same value as 甲). So 乙 is also 4.

**Question:** I have a thing that isn't there yet, and I want to obtain the value through a calculation, then name it. How?
**Answer:** Like this:

```
加一以三。名之曰「丙」。
```

**Question:** I get many values from calculations. Can I name them all?
**Answer:** Yes.

```
加一以三。加六以九。名之曰「甲」。曰「乙」。
```

**Question:** Ah, now I get it. For unnamed variables, `其` ("it") takes the nearest and ignores the rest; `書之` ("write it down", i.e. `print`) prints them all, and `名之` ("name it") takes the same amount of values as listed. Am I getting that right?
**Answer:** Yes, that's exactly it!

**Question:** Every time I declare an unnamed variable, it keeps track of it, and it will build up eventually. Now I want to discard them, what do I do?
**Answer:** write `噫`. It's an interjection that is supposed to be a sigh.

This would be the basics of variables.
